# README Generator

## Background

We are to develop a console node application using inquirer to take input from the user and generate a README.md file which can be used in a project.

## User Story

```text
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

    Create a command-line application that accepts user input.
    When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:
        The title of my project
        
        Sections entitled:
        Description
        Table of Contents
        Installation
        Usage
        License
        Contributing
        Tests
        Questions

    When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.
    When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
    When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
    When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.
    When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.
    When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
